            It is essential that our readers can read our website clearly and that
            is why I chose this type of font for the titles that make the page easy
            to read and that can bring a wonderful experience through reading and
            also through the page content.

            Helvetica is a good choice of typeface for reading that also gives the
            feeling of being easy to read. I want the reader to have a good
            experience within the website and to be able to read the characteristics
            of each part of the site very well, including the longer paragraphs.
          </p>

            Normal paragraph example

          <p>
            The company of any pet always evokes tenderness, company, and
            friendship, qualities that intensify when loneliness seeks to filter
            into people's lives; It is in these moments when the pet acquires a more
            important role, feeling it part of the family and even more, as a
            friend. Most people show a positive attitude through their relationship
            with a pet or companion animal, especially those who suffer from
            psychological or physical problems.
          </p>

          <p class="colored">
            For the ecological balance, animals play a determining role. They are
            leading actors in a large part of the phenomena and processes that meet
            the appropriate conditions for life. Even the tiniest animal on the
            planet plays a vital role in its ecosystem, so a change in its eating
            habits, that is, in food chains, can compromise the survival of
            everything around it.
